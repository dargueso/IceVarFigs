PIOMAS DATA v2.1 used in my version of these scripts were downloaded (and move to the final directory aftewards) using:

wget --recursive --no-check-certificate  https://pscfiles.apl.uw.edu/zhang/PIOMAS/data/v2.1/heff/

The grid.txt that some scripts (i.e. plot_sit_PIOMAS_monthly_v2.py) need, can be obtained from:

http://psc.apl.uw.edu/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/data/model_grid

and then in Methods and Data:

grid.dat (https://pscfiles.apl.washington.edu/zhang/PIOMAS/utilities/grid.dat) that we must rename to grid.txt


Some scripts also use monthly_piomas.txt (Monthly Artic Sea Ice Volume)that we updated to 2019 from:

http://psc.apl.uw.edu/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/data/
